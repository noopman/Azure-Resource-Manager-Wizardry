Use the same template and parameter file that you created in the previous exercise.

1. Launch ISE as Administrator.
2. Open the file Startup.ps1 and run it step by step to learn what it does.
    * Basically it signs you into Azure and lets you specify which subscription to use.
3. Open the file "\02Parameters\DeployAzure.ps1.
    * Replace the four variables with your files and custom names.
    * Execute the script line by line to learn what it does.
4. Verify in portal.azure.com that the resources are created in Azure.
