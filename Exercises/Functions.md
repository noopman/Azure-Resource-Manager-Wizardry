# Azure Resource Manager Wizardry Workshop
## Use Visual Studio to Create Multiple deployments with parameters

Use one of your existing templates or create a new one with perhaps a WebApp and a WebFarm.

1. Open the file Startup.ps1 and run it.
2. Open the files in 05Functions and inspect them.
3. One the file 05Functions\DeployTemplate.ps1 in ISE.
    * Run the different calls to New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment and see what you get back.
